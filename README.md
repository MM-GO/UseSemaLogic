# Obsidian SemaLogic PlugIn

It is possible to use SemaLogic (<https://semalogic.de>) in Obsidian (<https://obsidian.md>).

SemaLogic is a symbolic AI, that can be adapted to natural language in order to represent logical relationships unambiguously in a coherent language that is both computer and user understandable. The three forms of SemaLogic (natural language, technical language and practical representation) can be converted into each other at any time without loss of logical relationships in the understanding of the respective user.

**Note:** The SemaLogic-Obsidian API is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!

Currently the plugin is in development status and for testing SemaLogic to show technical language, graphical pictures in realtime and e.g. part of the SVGs in pdf directly.

## First use cases for pdf-display

First SemaLogic Commands which are available are

1. Show technical language in seperate view (through a dice on left side controls)
2. Preview-HTML-Commands by using "SemaLogic()" e.g.

- Show Help
- Show Version
- Set Dialect with template

3. Hand over the results of SemaLogic to an asp-specified-SemaLogic-service for solving

## How to use

After installation there shoud be a first profile for connecting the SemaLogic service in the web on service.semalogic.ddns.net.
